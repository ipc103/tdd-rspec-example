## Contents

The repo contatins an implementation of fizz_buzz, as well as some different approaches to testing.

1. `long_test.rb` has some explicit methods to test our `fizz_buzz` method. Run `ruby long_test.rb` to execute these tests.
2. `my_test_framework.rb` - a loose implementation of `describe` and `it`. Run  `ruby fizz_buzz_test.rb` to see this in action.
3. A spec directory using an Rspec impementation. Run `gem install rspec` (if needed) and `rspec` to execute these.
